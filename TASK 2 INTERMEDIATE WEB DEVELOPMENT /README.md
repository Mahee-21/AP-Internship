# 🚀 Task 2 Completed – Productivity Web App 💜📋

This is my second internship project at **ApexPlanet Software Pvt Ltd**, built as part of the Frontend Web Development Internship. The project focuses on combining design and functionality using only **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, presented in a soft, pastel-themed interface.

## 🎯 Objective

To build a visually engaging and interactive dual-feature web application with:

- 💌 A responsive **Contact Form UI** with animated 3D effects  
- 📋 A **To-Do List** app with real-time checkbox completion and remove option  
- 🎨 A soft **pastel purple animated gradient background**  
- 🖼️ Scroll-based layout — Image on one side, form on the other

## 📸 Features

- 📩 3D-styled **Contact Form** with smooth animations  
- ✔ **To-Do List**: Add tasks, strike with checkbox, remove with ✖  
- 🧭 Scroll-based **two-section layout** with reversed flex direction  
- 🌈 Animated pastel purple background
